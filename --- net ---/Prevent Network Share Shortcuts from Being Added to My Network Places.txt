Prevent Network Share Shortcuts from Being Added to My Network Places
When you open a file that is located on a file server share,
a shortcut to the server share is automatically added to My Network Places.
This article describes how to disable this functionality. When you open a file
(or a Microsoft FrontPage web) from a Universal Naming Convention (UNC) share,
a shortcut to the share is placed in My Network Places.
To disable this functionality, you must change the local system policy or network policy to
prevent servers from being added to My Network Places.
