original folder is in:
C:\Users\Elad\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\SendTo
you can change its location, like documents or pictures folders. 
make sure to place a shortcut in BOTH
  C:\Users\Elad\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows
and
  C:\Users\Elad\
for the newer location, named 'SendTo' (.lnk).
so when you WIN+R and write 'sendto' [ENTER] it will work (also an indication for probably other things that needs it to work as well).
